# transpiler-expressions Specification

## Purpose
How eqc translates a C# expression or pattern into the JavaScript twin: the answer the twin gives
is the one .NET gives.

## Requirements

### Requirement: An extended property pattern reads each member of its path

An extended property pattern (`{ A.B: pattern }`) SHALL be translated as the nested pattern
`{ A: { B: pattern } }`: each member of the path named as a member access names it, and a member
that is null before the last SHALL make the pattern answer false.

#### Scenario: A count through a member

- **WHEN** `new Bag(new List<int> { 1, 2 }, null) switch { { Items.Count: > 1 } => 1, _ => 0 }` runs
- **THEN** it answers 1, as .NET does

#### Scenario: A null on the path

- **WHEN** `new Bag(new List<int> { 1 }, null) switch { { Corner.X: 0 } => 1, _ => 0 }` runs
- **THEN** it answers 0, as .NET does, and nothing throws

### Requirement: A string crosses whole

Every string literal a twin holds, a declared default included, SHALL be written with its line
breaks escaped, so the module parses and the value is the one .NET holds.

#### Scenario: A default holding a line break

- **WHEN** `record Sep(string Joined = "a" + "\n", char Line = '\n', string Plain = "\r\n")` is
  constructed without arguments and its three members are concatenated
- **THEN** the answer is `a`, a line feed, a line feed, a carriage return and a line feed, as .NET
  gives it
